# RMV System Handoff Guide

This workspace contains the RMV Stainless Steel Fabrication thesis system. It is split into a React frontend, an Express backend, deployment assets, and operational notes for the VPS.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 22 or newer
- npm
- MongoDB Atlas connection string or local MongoDB
- Backend `.env` file in `rmv-server/.env`

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd rmv-server
npm install

cd ../rmv-web
npm install
```

Run the backend:

```bash
cd rmv-server
npm run dev
```

Run the frontend in another terminal:

```bash
cd rmv-web
npm run dev
```

## Business Flow Summary

The current implemented flow is documented in detail in `SYSTEM_SPEC.md`. High-level flow:

1. Customer registers, verifies OTP, completes profile, and logs in.
2. Customer books an office consultation.
3. Appointment agent or admin confirms and assigns sales staff.
4. Sales staff completes consultation and submits consultation report.
5. A project is created or updated from the report.
6. Sales staff creates/finalizes the ocular appointment after the consultation stage.
7. Customer submits site location for ocular fee calculation.
8. Ocular visit is completed and ocular report is submitted.
9. Engineer reviews site data, signs engineer contract, then uploads blueprint/costing.
10. Customer approves blueprint and costing or requests revisions.
11. Customer selects payment plan, signs contract, and pays active stages.
12. Cashier verifies payments.
13. Fabrication progresses through workshop stages.
14. Customer confirms installation when ready for delivery.
15. Fabrication reaches done and project becomes completed.
16. Customer can submit or skip a review.

Important current behavior:

- Customer self-booking is consultation-first. Customers do not directly self-book ocular visits.
- Ocular creation and finalization are sales-staff-owned in the backend.
- Customer site location is required at the ocular stage.
- Manual proof upload for project stage payments is not the active flow.
- PayMongo/QR and cash handling are the current payment paths.

## Environment Variables

Backend env file location:

```text
rmv-server/.env
```

Create one from the example when setting up locally:

```bash
cd rmv-server
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variable names:

```env
NODE_ENV
PORT
API_PREFIX
MONGODB_URI
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRY
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRY
COOKIE_DOMAIN
COOKIE_SECURE
COOKIE_SAMESITE
CORS_ORIGIN
EMAIL_PROVIDER
SMTP_HOST
SMTP_PORT
SMTP_USER
SMTP_PASS
SMTP_FROM_EMAIL
SMTP_FROM_NAME
SENDGRID_API_KEY
RESEND_API_KEY
R2_ACCOUNT_ID
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
R2_BUCKET_NAME
R2_PUBLIC_URL
ORS_API_KEY
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL
SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD
SUPER_ADMIN_FIRST_NAME
SUPER_ADMIN_LAST_NAME
CSRF_SECRET
PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY
PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET
FRONTEND_URL
FEATURE_DIRECT_OCULAR_STAFF_ENABLED
FEATURE_DIRECT_OCULAR_CUSTOMER_ENABLED
FEATURE_DIRECT_OCULAR_STAFF_PILOT_IDS
FEATURE_DIRECT_OCULAR_CUSTOMER_PILOT_IDS
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_B64
```

Never commit `.env` files. They are ignored by `.gitignore`.

For handoff, transfer the real `.env` through a private channel or password manager, then place it at `rmv-server/.env`. If pulling from the VPS, copy it to the developer machine without committing it:

```bash
scp root@188.166.177.69:/opt/rmv/rmv-server/.env ./rmv-server/.env
```

Production env lives on the VPS at:

```text
/opt/rmv/rmv-server/.env
```

## Firebase Note

The frontend Firebase web config is currently hardcoded in:

```text
rmv-web/src/lib/firebase.ts
```

That config identifies the Firebase project for browser auth. The backend Firebase Admin service account is separate and should be provided through:

```env
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_B64
```

## Deployment

See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for full production instructions.

Production overview:

- Domain: `rmvfabrication.app`
- VPS IP: `188.166.177.69`
- Backend repo path on VPS: `/opt/rmv/rmv-server`
- Frontend repo path on VPS: `/opt/rmv/rmv-web`
- Reverse proxy: Nginx
- SSL: Let's Encrypt via Certbot
- Containers: API, web, nginx, certbot

Common local SSH helper usage:

```powershell
cd ops-tools
$env:VPS_HOST = "188.166.177.69"
$env:VPS_USER = "root"
$env:VPS_PASSWORD = "YOUR_PASSWORD"

node run-ssh.mjs "docker ps"
node run-ssh.mjs "docker logs rmv-api --tail 50"
```

Common VPS commands:

```bash
docker ps -a
docker logs rmv-api --tail 100
docker logs rmv-nginx --tail 50

cd /opt/rmv/rmv-server/deploy
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart api
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

## Testing and Quality Checks

Backend:

```bash
cd rmv-server
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run smoke:api
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd rmv-web
npm run build
npm run test
npm run test:contrast
```

Run both builds before handoff or demo:

```bash
cd rmv-server && npm run build
cd ../rmv-web && npm run build
```

## Common Development Tasks

Add a new backend feature:

1. Add or update a model in `rmv-server/src/models/` if persistence is needed.
2. Add validation in the target module's `*.validation.ts`.
3. Add service logic in `*.service.ts`.
4. Add controller handlers in `*.controller.ts`.
5. Add route bindings in `*.routes.ts`.
6. Mount a new route group in `src/app.ts` only if it is a new module.
7. Add focused tests for the service or route behavior.

Add a new frontend page:

1. Create the page in `rmv-web/src/pages/`.
2. Add API access through `src/hooks/` or `src/lib/api.ts`.
3. Add route in `src/App.tsx`.
4. Add navigation in `src/components/layout/navigation.ts` if it should appear in menus.
5. Use existing UI components from `src/components/ui/`.

Change a status flow:

1. Check constants in `rmv-web/src/lib/constants.ts`.
2. Check backend enums/models in `rmv-server/src/models/`.
3. Check service guards in the related module.
4. Update `SYSTEM_SPEC.md` if the business flow changes.
5. Add or update tests around blocked and allowed transitions.

## Troubleshooting

Backend fails on startup:

- Check `rmv-server/.env`.
- Confirm `MONGODB_URI` is valid.
- Confirm required production secrets are not default placeholder values.
- Run `npm run typecheck`.

Frontend cannot call API:

- Confirm backend is running on port `5000`.
- Confirm `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173` in backend `.env`.
- Confirm requests are going to `/api/v1`.

CSRF errors:

- The frontend fetches `/api/v1/csrf-token`.
- Mutating requests send `X-CSRF-Token`.
- Check `COOKIE_DOMAIN`, `COOKIE_SECURE`, and `COOKIE_SAMESITE`.
- For local development, use `COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost`, `COOKIE_SECURE=false`, `COOKIE_SAMESITE=lax`.

Emails not sending:

- Check `EMAIL_PROVIDER`.
- For SMTP, check `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, and `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL`.
- For SendGrid or Resend, check the matching API key.

Uploads fail:

- Check Cloudflare R2 variables.
- Confirm bucket CORS if uploads or public URLs fail.
- Check `R2_PUBLIC_URL`.

Payments fail:

- Check `PAYMONGO_SECRET_KEY`.
- Check `PAYMONGO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` if webhooks are enabled.
- For sandbox testing, use PayMongo test credentials and test payment methods.

## Files to Read First

For a new groupmate, read in this order:

1. `README.md`
2. `SYSTEM_SPEC.md`
3. `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
4. `rmv-server/src/config/env.ts`
5. `rmv-server/src/app.ts`
6. `rmv-web/src/App.tsx`
7. `rmv-web/src/lib/api.ts`
8. `rmv-web/src/lib/constants.ts`

## Handoff Checklist

- `rmv-server/.env` is present locally and not committed.
- Backend installs and runs with `npm run dev`.
- Frontend installs and runs with `npm run dev`.
- Super admin login works.
- Health check returns success.
- At least one customer, sales staff, engineer, cashier, and admin account exists for testing.
- MongoDB Atlas allows the current IP or VPS IP.
- Email provider is working for OTP/password reset.
- R2 upload credentials work if testing photos, contracts, receipts, or blueprints.
- PayMongo sandbox keys work if testing online payments.
- `SYSTEM_SPEC.md` still matches any workflow changes.
